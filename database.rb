# Introduction:
#
# this file is all you need to create a database, setup that database,
# connect to it and interact with it using SQLite3.
#
# if you're not sure what this is about, just keep reading and try running
# this script, look at the output and think about what's happening.
#
# if you're already comfortable with all of this, good for you.  rejoice!
# ---------------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------

# first, choose to name your database.  SQLite databases live in one file:
# feel free to be creative.  this will be the name of your file
DATABASE_NAME = 'bidders'

# require the gem sqlite3.  You must type `gem install sqlite3` at the command line
# if not, you'll get this error: `cannot load such file -- sqlite3`
require 'sqlite3'

# Faker makes fake data.  Same deal on the gem
require 'faker'


# Set up a connection to the database you have created
# Simply running this command creates a database in your working directory
db_connection = SQLite3::Database.new "#{DATABASE_NAME}.db"

# the following warning message comes up when you run this script.
# if you want to avoid it, uncomment this single following line:

# I18n.enforce_available_locales = false # uncomment THIS line to avoid the message below

# ---------------------------------------
# [deprecated] I18n.enforce_available_locales will default to true in the future.
# If you really want to skip validation of your locale you can set
#   I18n.enforce_available_locales = false
# to avoid this message.
# ---------------------------------------

# use the methods provided by the Database class in the gem to
# interact with the database

# ---------------------------------------
# cleanup (if we've run this more than once)
# ---------------------------------------

# you don't need to use the word SQL below.  it's a "heredoc" (read about it) in Ruby
